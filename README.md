<div style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">

</div>

Besides using Next.js capabilities to implement this dashboard, I have included many modern js packeges in this project:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **TailwindCSS**
- **React-hook-form** and **Zod** for validating form
- **React-Calendar** and **React-Big-Calendar** for displaying beatiful caledars

I'm currently developing this dashboard to make it fetch real data using **Prisma** from **PostgeSQL** database already which I have deployed using **Docker**
